# Autoload: seamless stair transition between two mid-building floors.
#
# The trick that removes BOTH the grey void and the hard cut:
#   * Every floor scene draws its floor at the SAME world coordinates, so a plain
#     change_scene() snaps the world back to origin — that snap IS the hard cut.
#   * We instead load the neighbour floor as a passive backdrop stacked EXACTLY
#     one floor-height away (contiguous, no gap → no grey between floors), then
#     move the player + a standalone camera RIGIDLY TOGETHER by one floor. The
#     player stays fixed on screen while the two stacked floors scroll past
#     (reads as descending/ascending).
#   * The pan ends on the precise framing the destination scene will load into,
#     so when we finally change_scene the first new frame is pixel-identical to
#     the last pan frame — the commit is invisible.
#
# ENABLED is THE switch. If anything is missing it falls back to a plain cut so a
# descent never soft-locks. Feel/timing is tunable via the *_TIME constants.
